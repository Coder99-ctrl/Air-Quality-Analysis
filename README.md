# Air-Quality-Analysis

ðŸ”Ž Air Quality Data Analysis | Complete EDA Project ðŸŒ¿ðŸ“ˆ

Recently completed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an Air Quality dataset, focusing on extracting meaningful insights through data visualization and statistical analysis.

Key Highlights:

 âœ… Data Cleaning and Pre-processing for accurate and consistent analysis

 âœ… Histograms, Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, and Box Plots for visual exploration

 âœ… Z-Test applied to validate hypotheses on pollutant concentration differences

 âœ… Correlation Heatmap to uncover relationships between multiple pollutants

 âœ… Seasonal and geographic pollutant patterns identified with detailed visualizations

Tools Used:

 ðŸ”¹ Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Objectives Achieved:

 ðŸ“Œ Identified critical pollutants affecting air quality

 ðŸ“Œ Detected temporal trends and anomaly patterns

 ðŸ“Œ Highlighted key correlations between different air quality indicators

 ðŸ“Œ Generated insights to support environmental monitoring initiatives

ðŸ“‚ Project Deliverables Include:

 ðŸ”¸ Cleaned and processed dataset

 ðŸ”¸ Full set of annotated EDA visualizations

 ðŸ”¸ Statistical hypothesis testing results

 ðŸ”¸ Analytical summaries and insights


This project strengthens my capabilities in environmental data analysis, statistical inference, and impactful visualization â€” essential skills for today's data-driven solutions. ðŸŒ±
